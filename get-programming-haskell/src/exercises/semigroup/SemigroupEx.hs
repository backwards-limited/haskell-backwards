{-
Add more than two colors.
i.e. instead of the simplest semigroup such as:
Blue <> Red
we have:
(Blue <> Red) <> Yellow

You want your color mixing to be associative.
Associative means that the order in which you apply your <> operator doesnâ€™t matter.
For numbers, this means that
1 + (2 + 3) = (1 + 2) + 3
